# Recruitr - Full Stack AI Recruiting Application

### Overview
Recruitr is a full-stack AI-powered recruiting application designed to streamline the hiring process. It leverages AI to rank and match candidates against job descriptions using a multi-factor scoring algorithm. The application aims to automate resume analysis, generate comprehensive candidate profiles, and provide recruiters with insightful data to make informed hiring decisions.

### System Architecture

#### UI/UX Decisions
- **Color Schemes**: Utilizes professional, clean aesthetics with gradient cards and subtle shadows.
- **Templates**: Consistent layout across pages with a focus on clear information presentation.
- **Design Approaches**: Responsive design using TailwindCSS for optimal viewing on various devices. Uses status badges, score progress bars, and icon-based cues for intuitive interaction.

#### Technical Implementations
**Backend (FastAPI)**
- **Database**: SQLite, managed with SQLAlchemy ORM.
  - **Schema**: `candidates`, `candidate_artifacts`, `candidate_profiles`, `jobs`, `matches`, `applications`, `feedback`, `company_profile`.
  - **Applications Table**: Many-to-many relationship tracking between candidates and jobs:
    - Fields: id, candidate_id, job_id, applied_at, application_status (applied/reviewing/interviewing/rejected/hired), notes
    - Unique constraint on (candidate_id, job_id) prevents duplicate applications
    - Enables application tracking separate from AI matching
  - **Jobs Table**: Includes dual-format LinkedIn storage:
    - `linkedin_original_text` - Raw pasted LinkedIn job text
    - `display_description` - HTML-formatted description preserving original LinkedIn structure
    - `description` - AI-generated summary for quick reference
- **API Endpoints**:
  - **Candidates**: CRUD operations, artifact management, AI profile generation and retrieval, job application management.
    - `POST /candidates/{candidate_id}/apply/{job_id}`: Apply candidate to job (prevents duplicates)
    - `GET /candidates/{candidate_id}/applications`: Get all jobs candidate applied to (uses JOIN to avoid N+1 queries)
    - `DELETE /applications/{application_id}`: Remove application
    - `PUT /applications/{application_id}/status`: Update application status (applied/reviewing/interviewing/rejected/hired)
  - **Jobs**: CRUD operations, listing jobs with match counts, AI-powered job creation tools, candidate matching, multi-level evaluation pipelines, LinkedIn import with screening questions, applicant tracking.
