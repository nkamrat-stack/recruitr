Build job application system with many-to-many candidate-job relationships:

BACKEND DATABASE (database.py):
Create new table: applications

Fields:
- id (primary key)
- candidate_id (foreign key to candidates)
- job_id (foreign key to jobs)
- applied_at (timestamp, default now)
- application_status (TEXT: "applied", "reviewing", "interviewing", "rejected", "hired")
- notes (TEXT, optional - internal notes about application)

Add unique constraint: (candidate_id, job_id) - prevent duplicate applications

BACKEND API (app/routers/candidates.py):
Add endpoints:
- POST /candidates/{candidate_id}/apply/{job_id} - Apply candidate to job
- DELETE /applications/{application_id} - Remove application
- GET /candidates/{candidate_id}/applications - Get all jobs candidate applied to
- PUT /applications/{application_id}/status - Update application status

BACKEND API (app/routers/jobs.py):
Add endpoints:
- GET /jobs/{job_id}/applicants - Get all candidates who applied to this job
- GET /jobs/{job_id}/applicant-count - Get count of applicants

FRONTEND - UPLOAD RESUME FLOW (pages/upload-resume or relevant page):
Update to include job selection:
1. After uploading resume, show dropdown: "Apply to job (optional)"
2. Dropdown lists all open jobs
3. If job selected, create application record
4. Show success: "Resume uploaded and applied to [Job Name]"
5. Allow "Apply to Additional Jobs" button after upload

FRONTEND - CANDIDATES LIST (pages/candidates/index.js):
Add "Applied Jobs" column:
- Show badges for each job candidate applied to
- Click badge to view job
- "Apply to Job" button for each candidate
- Shows "Not applied to any jobs" if no applications

FRONTEND - JOB DETAIL PAGE (pages/jobs/[id].js):
Add applicant tracking:
1. Header shows: "ðŸ“¥ 50 Applicants" badge
2. "View Matches" button dropdown with 2 options:
   - "Match Applicants Only" (default) - only candidates who applied
   - "Match All Candidates" - everyone in database
3. Show applicant count even before extraction

FRONTEND - JOB MATCHES PAGE (pages/jobs/[id]/matches.js):
Update to handle filtering:
1. Add toggle at top: 
   - "Show Applicants Only" (default, shows only candidates who applied)
   - "Show All Candidates" (shows everyone, ranked)
2. Badge on each candidate: "âœ“ Applied" vs "Not Applied"
3. Different visual treatment for applicants vs non-applicants
4. Allow "Add to Applicants" button for non-applicants

FRONTEND - ADD APPLY FUNCTIONALITY:
Create modal/dropdown for applying candidates to jobs:
- Shows list of open jobs
- Checkbox for each job
- "Apply" button
- Success message

UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS:
- Jobs list shows "X applicants" badge on each card
- Candidates list shows which jobs they've applied to
- Easy way to apply candidate to job from either side
- Application status dropdown (Applied â†’ Reviewing â†’ Interviewing â†’ Rejected/Hired)

Make the workflow intuitive: Upload â†’ Apply to Job â†’ Match â†’ Review â†’ Update Status
