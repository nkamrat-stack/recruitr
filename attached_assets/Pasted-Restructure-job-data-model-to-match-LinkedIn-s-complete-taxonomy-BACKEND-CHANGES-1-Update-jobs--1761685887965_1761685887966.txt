Restructure job data model to match LinkedIn's complete taxonomy:

BACKEND CHANGES:

1. Update jobs table schema (database.py):
   Add these JSON columns:
   - responsibilities (JSON) - Categories with tasks
   - required_qualifications (JSON) - With weights and types
   - preferred_qualifications (JSON) - With weights
   - competencies (JSON) - Soft skills and traits
   - success_milestones (JSON) - Timeline-based expectations
   - work_requirements (JSON) - Timezone, remote policy, etc.
   - application_deliverables (JSON) - What candidates must submit
   
   Keep existing:
   - linkedin_original_text (raw paste)
   - display_description (HTML for display)
   - description (AI summary)
   - screening_questions (already exists)

2. Rewrite parse_linkedin_job() in ai_service.py:
   
   A) Display HTML - Use simple text_to_html() function (NO AI):
      - Convert plain text to HTML
      - Preserve EXACT content
      - Just add formatting tags
   
   B) Structured Data - Use GPT-4o to extract ALL categories:
      - responsibilities (array of {category, tasks})
      - required_qualifications (array with type, weight, min/max years, skills)
      - preferred_qualifications (array with type, weight)
      - competencies (array with name, description, importance)
      - success_milestones (array with timeframe, expectations)
      - work_requirements (timezone, remote_policy, visa_sponsorship, hours_per_week)
      - application_deliverables (array with name, type, required, weight)
      - screening_questions (array with question, type, ideal_answer, is_required, weight, deal_breaker)
   
   Use detailed AI prompt that explains each category and gives examples.

3. Update job endpoints to handle all new fields

FRONTEND CHANGES:

1. Update job detail page tabs:
   - Description tab: Show display_description (formatted original)
   - Requirements tab: Show all structured data nicely formatted
   - Screening Questions tab: Show questions with weights and deal-breakers

2. Update job creation form to accept all new fields (can be optional for now - AI will extract from LinkedIn)

The goal: Every piece of data in the LinkedIn job post is captured in a structured, matchable format.
