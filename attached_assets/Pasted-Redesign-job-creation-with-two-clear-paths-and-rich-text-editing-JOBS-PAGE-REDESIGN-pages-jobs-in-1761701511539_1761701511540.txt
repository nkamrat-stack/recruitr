Redesign job creation with two clear paths and rich text editing:

JOBS PAGE REDESIGN (pages/jobs/index.js):
Replace "+ Create New Job" button with two prominent options:

[ðŸ“‹ Import from LinkedIn]  [âœ¨ Create with AI]

Two separate modals/flows.

FLOW 1: Import from LinkedIn (Keep existing, minor tweaks):
- Modal with Job Title, Location, Description textarea, Screening Questions
- "Import Job" button (saves immediately)
- Redirects to job detail page

FLOW 2: Create with AI (NEW):
Modal with form fields:
- Job Title (required)
- Location (required)
- Key Responsibilities (textarea with bullets, placeholder: "â€¢ Manage product roadmap\nâ€¢ Lead engineering team")
- Required Skills (comma-separated)
- Nice-to-Have Skills (comma-separated)
- Salary Range (min/max)
- Hours/week
- Additional Context (textarea, optional: "Our company culture, team size, growth stage, etc.")

Button: "ðŸ¤– Generate Job Description with AI"

When clicked:
- Calls new endpoint: POST /jobs/generate-from-form
- AI writes full LinkedIn-style job description using provided info
- Shows preview of generated description
- User can edit in-place with basic formatting
- "Save Job" button

BACKEND - NEW ENDPOINT (app/routers/jobs.py):
POST /jobs/generate-from-form

Takes form data, uses GPT-4o to generate full job description in LinkedIn format:
- Writes Position Overview
- Expands responsibilities into detailed sections
- Writes About the Role, Requirements, etc.
- Formats professionally like LinkedIn posts
- Returns formatted HTML

EDIT MODE REDESIGN (pages/jobs/[id].js):
When user clicks "Edit" button:

Instead of opening form with basic fields, open rich text editor modal:

1. Show current display_description in editable format
2. Basic formatting toolbar:
   - Bold, Italic buttons
   - Heading dropdown (H2, H3, Paragraph)
   - Bullet list, Numbered list buttons
   - Undo, Redo
3. Use a simple rich text library like:
   - react-quill (lightweight WYSIWYG)
   - OR draft.js
   - OR just contentEditable div with basic toolbar
4. "Save Changes" updates display_description
5. "Cancel" closes without saving

EXPORT FEATURE:
On job detail page, "ðŸ“‹ Copy for LinkedIn" button:
- Converts HTML to clean formatted text
- Copies to clipboard
- Works from anywhere (detail page, after editing)

Make the two creation paths visually distinct and equally prominent on Jobs page.
The editing experience should feel like editing a Google Doc, not a form.
