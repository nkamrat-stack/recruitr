Enhance job creation to support fully configurable multi-level evaluation pipeline:

BACKEND (app/routers/jobs.py and database.py):

1. Update jobs table schema:
   - Add company_profile_id (foreign key to company_profile)
   - Add evaluation_levels (JSON text storing array of level configurations)

2. Each level in the JSON should have:
   - level_number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - level_name (user enters: "Initial Screen", "Technical Review", etc.)
   - required_deliverables (array of strings: ["resume", "loom_video", "custom_questionnaire"])
   - optional_deliverables (array of strings)
   - advance_count (integer or null if it's the final level)

3. Update POST /jobs/ and PUT /jobs/{id} to accept evaluation_levels array

FRONTEND (pages/jobs/index.js):

1. Add "Evaluation Pipeline" section in job creation modal:
   - Starts with 1 default level
   - "+ Add Level" button (can add unlimited levels)
   - Each level shows:
     * Level number (auto-numbered: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3...)
     * Level Name input (text: user defines name like "Initial Screen")
     * Required Deliverables section:
       - Preset checkboxes for common types:
         □ Resume
         □ Loom Video
         □ Cover Letter
         □ Questionnaire
         □ Portfolio
         □ GitHub
         □ Code Sample
         □ Interview Transcript
       - "+ Add Custom Deliverable" button to add any other type
       - Custom deliverable: text input for name
     * Optional Deliverables (same interface as required)
     * Advance Count input (number: "Top 50", "Top 10", or "All" for final level)
     * "Remove Level" button (can't remove if only 1 level)
     * Up/Down arrows to reorder levels

2. Validation:
   - At least 1 level required
   - Each level must have at least 1 required deliverable
   - Last level should have advance_count = null (final stage)

3. Visual design:
   - Each level in a collapsible card with level number badge
   - Clear visual separation between levels
   - Show level progression (Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3)

Make it intuitive - users should be able to build any hiring pipeline they want with any number of stages and any types of deliverables.
