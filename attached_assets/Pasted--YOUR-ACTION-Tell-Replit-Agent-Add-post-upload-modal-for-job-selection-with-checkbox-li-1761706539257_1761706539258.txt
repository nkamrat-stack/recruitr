**ðŸ“‹ YOUR ACTION:**

Tell Replit Agent:
```
Add post-upload modal for job selection with checkbox list:

UPLOAD RESUME FLOW (pages/upload-resume or relevant page):

1. Keep upload simple - just file upload, no job selection yet

2. AFTER successful upload, show modal:
   - Title: "âœ… Resume Uploaded Successfully!"
   - Subtitle: "Apply [Candidate Name] to jobs:"
   - List all OPEN jobs as checkboxes with:
     * Job title
     * Location
     * Date opened (formatted: "Opened: Jan 15, 2025")
   - Buttons:
     * "Skip" (bottom left) - closes modal, no applications created
     * "Apply to Selected Jobs" (bottom right, primary button)

3. When user clicks "Apply to Selected Jobs":
   - For each checked job, call: POST /candidates/{id}/apply/{job_id}
   - Creates application record in applications table
   - Show success toast: "Applied to 3 jobs: Backend Engineer, Senior Developer, Product Manager"
   - Close modal

4. "Skip" button behavior:
   - Closes modal
   - Candidate saved but not applied to any jobs
   - Can apply later from candidate profile

BACKEND - APPLICATIONS TABLE (database.py):
Create table if not exists: applications
- id (primary key)
- candidate_id (foreign key)
- job_id (foreign key)
- applied_at (timestamp, default now)
- application_status (TEXT: "applied", "reviewing", "interviewing", "rejected", "hired")
- UNIQUE constraint on (candidate_id, job_id) - prevent duplicate applications

BACKEND - APPLICATION ENDPOINTS (app/routers/candidates.py or jobs.py):
- POST /candidates/{candidate_id}/apply/{job_id} - Create application
- GET /jobs/{job_id}/applicants - Get all candidates who applied
- GET /jobs/{job_id}/applicant-count - Get count

JOBS LIST PAGE (pages/jobs/index.js):
- Show badge on each job card: "ðŸ“¥ 23 Applicants"
- Fetch count from /jobs/{id}/applicant-count

JOB DETAIL PAGE (pages/jobs/[id].js):
- Add "Applicants" tab
- Shows list of candidates who applied to THIS job
- Each candidate card has:
  * Name, email
  * Applied date
  * Status dropdown (Applied/Reviewing/Interviewing/Rejected/Hired)
  * "View Profile" button
  * "Match & Rank" button

Treat each application as independent - same candidate can be ranked differently for different jobs.
