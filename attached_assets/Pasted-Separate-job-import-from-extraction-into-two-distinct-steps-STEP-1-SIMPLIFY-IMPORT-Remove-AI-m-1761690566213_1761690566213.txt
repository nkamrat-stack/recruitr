Separate job import from extraction into two distinct steps:

STEP 1 - SIMPLIFY IMPORT (Remove AI, make instant):

1. Update "Import from LinkedIn" modal to have 3 simple fields:
   - Job Title (text input, required)
   - Location (text input, required)
   - Job Description (large textarea, required - paste full LinkedIn text)
   - Button: "Import Job" (NOT "Parse with AI")

2. When user clicks "Import Job":
   - Convert description to HTML using text_to_html() (no AI)
   - Save job with: job_title, location, display_description, extraction_status="not_extracted"
   - Do NOT call parse_linkedin_job() or extract taxonomy
   - Close modal immediately, show job in list
   - Should be instant (~1 second)

STEP 2 - ADD EXTRACTION BUTTON TO JOB DETAIL PAGE:

1. On job detail page (pages/jobs/[id].js), add prominent button at top:
   - If extraction_status = "not_extracted": Show big button "Extract Job Requirements"
   - If extraction_status = "extracted": Show badge "✅ Requirements Extracted" + small button "Re-extract"
   - If extraction_status = "extracting": Show loading spinner "Extracting requirements..."

2. When user clicks "Extract Job Requirements":
   - Call new endpoint: POST /jobs/{id}/extract-requirements
   - Show loading state
   - After completion, reload page to show extracted data
   - Update extraction_status to "extracted"

3. Create new backend endpoint: POST /jobs/{id}/extract-requirements
   - Gets job by ID
   - Calls parse_linkedin_job(job.display_description) with full taxonomy extraction
   - Saves all 7 JSON fields to job record
   - Updates extraction_status = "extracted"
   - Returns success

DISABLE MATCHING UNTIL EXTRACTED:

1. On job detail page, "View Candidate Matches" button should:
   - Be disabled (grayed out) if extraction_status != "extracted"
   - Show tooltip: "Extract job requirements first"
   - Be enabled (blue) if extraction_status = "extracted"

2. On jobs list page, add extraction status badge to each job card:
   - Gray badge "Not Parsed" if extraction_status = "not_extracted"
   - Green badge "Parsed" if extraction_status = "extracted"

The workflow should be crystal clear: Import (instant) → Extract (20 seconds) → Match
